Let's say that you want to customize the routes that were generated by the resources. You can override the routes that were generated by passing an `except` parameter into the routes resources.

For example, let's customize the UserController `destroy` method that is generated by resources in the `web.php` file so that we don't need to pass the `user` object whenever we call the `destroy` method.

## Finding the Routes
In the `web.php` we have declared to create resources for the UserController:

```
Route::resource('user', 'UserController');
```

To see the routes that were generated, we run `php artisan route:list`. For this example, we want to override the `destroy` method so we append `| grep destroy` to the `artisan` command to find all the `destroy` routes. The output should be similar as to below:

```
$ php artisan route:list | grep destroy
|   | DELETE  | users/account/{user}  | account.destroy    | App\Http\Controllers\UserController@destroy    | web,auth  |
```

## Modifying the Route
Once you've found the `destroy` route you want to override, create the route in your `web.php` file. Append `['except' => 'destroy']` to your resource as such:

```
Route::resource('users', 'UserController', ['except' => 'destroy']);
```

Then we re-create the route in the `web.php` file:

```
Route::delete('/users/account', ['uses' => 'UserController@destroy', 'as' => 'account.destroy']);
```

Then when we run the `php artisan route:list | grep destroy` again, we will see that our routes has been updated with the new route we created.

```
$ php artisan route:list | grep destroy
|   | DELETE  | users/account         | account.destroy    | App\Http\Controllers\UserController@destroy    | web,auth  |
```
